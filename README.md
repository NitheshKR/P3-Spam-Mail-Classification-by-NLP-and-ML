# P3-Spam-Mail-Classification-by-NLP-and-ML

<h1> This is Mail heading</h1>

<p>This project focuses on building a robust machine learning model to classify emails as spam or non-spam using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The dataset is preprocessed through tokenization, stop-word removal, and text vectorization methods like TF-IDF or Count Vectorizer to extract meaningful features. Various machine learning algorithms, such as Naive Bayes or Logistic Regression, are employed to train the model, and its performance is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The project also includes visualizations to provide insights into the dataset and model performance, making it an end-to-end solution for spam mail classification.</p>

<h2>How to Run the Project</h2>

<p>To execute the Spam Mail Classification project, start by cloning the repository and navigating to the project directory. Install the required dependencies using the requirements.txt file. Prepare the dataset by placing it in the appropriate folder, ensuring it contains labeled columns like Text (email content) and Label (spam/ham). Run the preprocessing script to clean and transform the data through tokenization, stop-word removal, and text vectorization. Train the machine learning model using the provided training script, which saves the trained model in the specified directory. Evaluate the model's performance using the testing script to generate metrics such as accuracy and F1 score. To classify new emails, run the prediction script with the desired email content as input. Optionally, use the included Jupyter Notebook for an interactive execution workflow, and check the results folder for visualizations and detailed reports.</p>
